              Future Design Factory is a passion-driven learning hub at <strong>NHL Stenden University of Applied
              Science</strong> open to national and international students, teachers, researchers, and businesses.
              Operating under the umbrella of CMD and part of the School of Design, we create Futures
              Visions for a better everyday life and design sustainable new solutions for people and the
              planet. In collaboration with various academies, we are building a multidisciplinary learning
              culture through the application of our Future Thinking theory combined with Design Based
              Education.

              Internationally, we join forces with 39 Design Factories and 8 European Schools of Art and
              Design through RUN-EU, fostering a growing global network. The Design Factory Global
              Network (DFGN) unites innovation hubs across universities and research organizations on five
              continents, all driven by a shared mission: transforming teaching, learning, and research
              through passion-based approaches and impactful problem-solving. This shared mindset and
              collaborative methodology enable seamless cooperation across cultures, time zones, and
              boundaries, igniting creativity and driving change. Together, we connect diverse talents, build
              partnerships, and advance education, proving that innovation knows no limits.
